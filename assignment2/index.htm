      <h2>Mayurasana</h2>
      <p>Among the intricate poses in Mallakhamb, the Mayurasana stance emerges as a truly captivating spectacle. As the name suggests, "Mayurasana," or Peacock Pose, draws inspiration from the majestic peacock's display of elegance and grandeur.

      <h2>Human Flag</h2>
      <p>Imagine, if you will, a vertical pole that seems to defy gravity. Now picture a practitioner gripping the pole horizontally, suspended high above the ground. The body is extended horizontally, parallel to the pole, defying the laws of physics. It's a display of immense strength, balance, and control – a spectacle that leaves spectators in awe.
